</li><li>触摸感很像电流扰动，因此体验内容也偏向于魔法球、水流、火焰的感受。有一幕将手穿越魔法门的感觉也特别好。</li><li>离形成smooth surface的触摸感还有一段距离。</li></ul></li><li><p>Pico Zense <a href="https://www.pico-interactive.com/zense" target="_blank"

rel="noopener">http://www.sensoryx.com/</a> </p><ul><li>仅需在头显前加一个传感器，带上特制手套，就能在VR游戏中识别双手。 <img src="/assets/blogimg/GDC2019_VRfree_Front_LQ.png" title="VR Free Glove"></li></ul></li><li><p>VICON 动作捕捉

rel="noopener">https://www.magicleap.com/</a></p><ul><li>在Unity与UE区域分别有两个体验区，一开馆就得去排队。。排了UE区的体验。体验内容是跟一个虚拟妹子一起做贴画。</li><li><img src="/assets/blogimg/GDC2019_MagicLeap.jpg" title="Magic Leap"></li><li>感觉很适合虚拟管家或虚拟女友，人物距离感挺不错。</li><li>就是视野感觉小，出了眼前的方形显示屏就没有画面的，虚拟人或物必须在正前方才容易看见。</li><li>略微有彩虹纹，貌似是浮雕光栅成像原理的因素。</li></ul></li><li><p>bHaptics <a href="https://www.bhaptics.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bhaptics.com/</a> </p><ul><li>Tactsuit体感衣，在VR FPS中如果身上部位被击中，该部位会产生震动。 <img src="/assets/blogimg/GDC2019_bHaptics.png" title="bHaptics Tacsuit"></li><li>跟小伙伴稍微yy了一下，未来这些sensor应该会更加精细与密集，并且能够制造一定压力，才能做出玩家一号那种体感衣吧。</li><li>做出来以后，应用最广的应该不是游戏业。。。</li></ul></li><li><p>Genvid, Interactive Streaming Engine <a href="https://www.genvidtech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.genvidtech.com/</a> </p><ul><li>互动直播观战引擎，在游戏开发时添加相应SDK，比如添加过个观战摄像机，在直播间的观众们就可以选择想要观看的摄像机。也能尝试点击游戏中的各种信息，实时查看游戏数据。 <img src="/assets/blogimg/GDC2019_Genvid.png" title="Genvid How It Works"></li><li>目前支持引擎Unity和Unreal，直播平台Twitch和YouTube。 </li><li>记得英雄联盟S8的直播就启用了互动观赛系统，应该是一类的。 </li></ul></li><li><p>imvu <a href="https://secure.imvu.com/welcome/ftux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://secure.imvu.com/welcome/ftux/</a> </p><ul><li><p>看上去像一个类似第二人生的在线多人虚拟社区？玩家可以自己上传角色模型、衣物模型贴图、场景等，然后标价卖给别的玩家，并且货币可以与真是货币兑换。 </p></li><li><p>貌似有手机app。那么渲染质量就十分有限了，看宣传上觉得不如第二人生。不过很高兴看到类似社区正在涌现。 <img src="/assets/blogimg/GDC2019_IMVU.jpg" title="IMVU"></p></li><li>小伙伴推荐了一个叫Zepeto的app，同样的手机在线虚拟社区。</li><li>那么趁机安利一下Sansar，多人VR在线虚拟社区 <a href="https://www.sansar.com/" target="_blank"

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Cyber Force</em> is a game that players perform as an ethical hacker hunting bugs in programs. Players enforce justice in the cyber world. The core mechanic is to find out the bugs among programs but the player need to be careful with his power – abuse will cause a domino effect and more bugs.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/CyberForce1.png" title="Cyber Force"><a id="more"></a><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/t-AF88MKcA8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><blockquote><p><em>Platform: PC</em></p><p><em>Engine (given): Unreal</em></p><p><em>Theme: Iteration on Brute Force</em></p><p><em>Audience: Gamers 20-40</em></p></blockquote><h2 id="My-contribution-to-the-project"><a href="#My-contribution-to-the-project" class="headerlink" title="My contribution to the project"></a>My contribution to the project</h2><p>In this project I perdormed as a Technical Artist. At first I was the only artist, and my team decided to use the minimal art style so that I can work more on tech-art things. After the personnel change we got another artist Cody, so after that I mainly focus on the effects inside the game. Specific works I have done are showed as follow:</p><ul><li>Growing effects and particle effects inside the game</li><li>Map build</li><li>UI assets</li><li>HowToPlay video (together with Ray)</li><li>Help publish the game</li></ul><img src="/assets/blogimg/CyberForce2.png" title="Cyber Force"><img src="/assets/blogimg/CyberForce3.png" title="Cyber Force"><h2 id="Different-things-to-do-next-time"><a href="#Different-things-to-do-next-time" class="headerlink" title="Different things to do next time"></a>Different things to do next time</h2><p>This time I really worked as a tech artist. I’m not very good at art work compare to other artists, but this time I found out what role is the most suitable for me. I forcused on the effects of arts, use program methods to make it better. These are still basic tech-art things, but they really enlightened me. So next time I should try more tech-art things to help the artists work better. I am really happy when doing my work.</p><h2 id="Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process"><a href="#Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process" class="headerlink" title="Things I learned from participating in this process"></a>Things I learned from participating in this process</h2><h3 id="Positive-lessons"><a href="#Positive-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Positive lessons:"></a>Positive lessons:</h3><p>The first thing is of course my attribution of Tech-Artist. I can apply the knowledge I got from my tech-art class to our game, and try to figure out how a tech-artist can do in a real game project. I didn’t need to do the art things I’m not familiar with, but help to make the art work better. That’s the best thing.</p><p>Second is the great communication between team members. This time our team got a good communication with each other. We had clear feature lists, and clear assignments for each member. Due to the great efficiency, we had playable version in every sprint, and discussed together what we could do better in the next version. That a very awesome experience.</p><p>Third is that our game got good number of downloads. Though not the most among all the groups, this still gave us confidence. Some downloaders also gave us feedbacks on the gameplay and art styles. Then we found that our game still need many improvement. So it is very important to test our game by normal players so that we can found some problems that we take for granted.</p><h3 id="Negative-lessons"><a href="#Negative-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Negative lessons:"></a>Negative lessons:</h3><p>First is that we lose a team member. This is a terrible feeling that we lost one of our main programmers. In real world we may not be such lucky to find another great programmer. It’s really bad feeling.</p><p>Second is that, as a technical artist, I still failed to implement the skeleton animation from Maya to Unreal. Finally due to time limitation, we decide to not use it.</p><p>Third is that we seemed to have some AI misunderstanding during our development. This is maybe because of our language expression. But finally we all got them done.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>The Modus Room</em> is a first-person puzzle game in which the player uses their mobile device to look and move around a room to examine and pick up objects in search for clues. When the players discovers a clues, they use the clues as solutions for the puzzles in order to find the key to the next rooms where more puzzles await.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/ModusRoom1.png" title="The Modus Room"><a id="more"></a><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Jkd6VGNnWok" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><blockquote><p><em>Platform(Given): Mobile</em></p><p><em>Engine(Given): Unity</em></p><p><em>Theme(Given): Film-Noir, Totalitarian, Dystopian, Tyrannical (Kim Jong-Un)</em></p><p><em>Audience(Given): Inter-city youth</em></p></blockquote><p>This time the process is not smooth as previous games. At first we tried to make a shooting game that the main character hold a gun walking on a dark street, and kill enemies who are selling guns and drugs and wanted to kill him. We even finished the core gameplay mechanic. But when the first pitch we got advice from others that since our audience is inner city youth - teenagers without educated and easily attracted by violence and drugs - which may cause bad influence in the real world, we considered to change our main gameplay. We originally have two weeks, but then we have only one week - actually less than 5 days to finish <em>The Modus Room</em>.</p><h2 id="My-contribution-to-the-project"><a href="#My-contribution-to-the-project" class="headerlink" title="My contribution to the project"></a>My contribution to the project</h2><p>In this project I perform as the only artist in our team. Yes it’s the same team as the previous game. My major contributin is the art works of the game. Specific aet works are showed as follow:</p><ul><li>UI including start screen background, buttons(some of them were not put in the final version due to the lack of time)</li><li>The house, including the building and furnitures inside</li><li>Trailer animation</li><li>Also a character with animation for our first idea, but dropped</li></ul><p>I also took part in our discussion on the two ideas we had, and voted for escape room the second time.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/ModusRoom2.png" title="The Modus Room"><img src="/assets/blogimg/ModusRoom3.png" title="The Modus Room"><h2 id="Different-things-to-do-next-time"><a href="#Different-things-to-do-next-time" class="headerlink" title="Different things to do next time"></a>Different things to do next time</h2><p>After three times of art work training, I’m now getting more and more familiar with art works in games. But I still need to improve a lot. I didn’t get professional art training, so sometimes lack the sense of combine colors, such as this time I finally found that I dark grey would look better than pure black. I think I have talked a lot with our teams this time, but I still need to communicate more next time.</p><p>Also about the idea change, members in the team should all think twice about whether the idea is feasible. We need to think critically about it next time, to avoid such things from happening again.</p><h2 id="Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process"><a href="#Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process" class="headerlink" title="Things I learned from participating in this process"></a>Things I learned from participating in this process</h2><p>This time many things left me deep impression.</p><h3 id="Positive-lessons"><a href="#Positive-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Positive lessons:"></a>Positive lessons:</h3><p>First thing is team running. We are the same team as the previous one, so we have known each other more. It seems that we communicate more free with each other this time. Also two of our programmers didn’t know unity very much last time, but they have got some idea about it this time, and that’s also why we can nearly finish the prototype in such a short time.</p><p>Second is our programmers’ hard work. They work very hard, and tried their best to finish the game in time. And they are very willing to communicate with the team.</p><p>Third is testing. This time the playable version came out more rapidly so we could see and test the game from time to time. I still have the test version installed on my phone.</p><h3 id="Negative-lessons"><a href="#Negative-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Negative lessons:"></a>Negative lessons:</h3><p>First is that we are more aware about the importance of team stay together. We were late to choose the seats, so we had to saperate to different places. So every meeting seems so pracious. And during the day we are always surrounded by different teams with their meetings. It’s not good for team works. And I think we didn’t handle it very good.</p><p>Second is that we are sometimes late for class. We always wanted to start meeting when the class is on, but often not all of us arrived including me for some reasons, so we just postponed the meeting. So after the meeting we usually didn’t have enough time in class. Though we had done better than before, this was still a big problem.</p><p>Third is that we didn’t have enough game design thing. We didn’t get agreed on the same ideas for puzzles to put in the game. Though our producer uploaded a design doc for puzzles for reference, we changed a lot in the final game without discussion, and so many of my assets were not used. Well this is actually still the problem of communication. We need someone to maintain the level things and design the puzzles carefully.</p>]]></content>

    <title>Fictive Context of NetRunner</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Android: NetRunner</em> is set in the fictional Android entertainment world. The whole world is a cyberpunk sci-fi world. How it works?</p><p>The word “punk” comes from punk rock, which is a rock music genre developed between 1974 and 1976. The term ”punk” was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics to describe garage bands and their devotees. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing style, stripped-sown instrumentation, so people use punk rock to express their emotions, and often with political, anti-establishment lyrics. They took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. So we can almost see what’s the feeling of “cyberpunk”. Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a future setting, which often center on a conflict among artificial intelligences and megacorporations. That future is often called the antithesis of the generally utpian visions. Megacprporations, cyberspace and hackers are always the basic setting in such stories.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner3_1.jpg" title="Four Megacorporations"><a id="more"></a><p>So we can see that the world of Android inherited nearly all the elements of cyberpunk. Four megacorporation - Haas-Bioroid, Jinteki, NBN, and Weyland Consortium - dominate nearly all essential aspect of human life, and three groups of runners - Anarchs, Criminals, and Shapers - as hackers trying to hack in to the megacorporations’ servers and reveal their crimes. <em>Figure 2</em> shows three runners from the core game card set.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner3_2.jpg" title="Three Runners From Core Game Card Set"><p>Such cyberpunk setting fits the main topic of <em>Android: NetRunner</em> very well. The games is played in a cyberspace, which the runner make runs to the corporations’ servers. Runners use programs, varius, hardware resources to improve his hacking ability, while corporations upgrad and build ice outside to protect servers. It is exactly like what the corporations and hackers do in the real world. To some extent the story is also a hard sic-fi story, which means its settings are very accurate or have a lot of technical details. We can find many terms of professional like install programs, trace and icebreaker which are really used in the real world.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner3_3.png" title="Stories of the Runners in the Rule Book"><p>The story of the world of <em>Android</em> is very long, which uses five books including the identity trilogy to describe the whole world. I haven’t read them. But there are also background stories for each megacorporation and runner in the rule book as those cards publised. We can see that the three groups of runners has their own skill sets and goals to pursue. Also each runner in the same group is different characterized, which can be found in the following extension packs. Their skills also are related to their settings. Such as Noise, his skill is to trash the top card of R&amp;D of the Corp whenever he installs a virus program, just like his bold and uninhibited character in the story, he easily hacked into the Corp for a lot of times, but no one could find the evidence.</p><p>Some cards that are not the main runner character also has their own stories. Like showed in <em>Figure 4(a)</em>, Bernice Mai is a professional in NBN, who is pro at trace. Runners invading the server under her manage all risk the danger of being traced and locked. So on the card, she has the trace strength of 5 - a very high strength - that the runner has to pay a lot to upgrad his varius or just get locked and receive the damage.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner3_4.png" title="Stories of General Cards"><p>Some cards together can tell a whole story. <em>Figure 4(b)</em> is the identity card of a Shaper called Nasir Meidan. He is good at trading - to trade what he want with his hack skill. So his skill is to lose all credits in his credit pool but gain the credits equal to the rez cost of that ice that would be more valuable to him. The event card Social Engineering (<em>Figure 4(c)</em>) tells the story that he tried a very clever way and get the tickets through trading, to get into the Beanstalk, where he can travel to other places of the solar system through Challenger spaceships.</p><p>These are just some cards. I think that we can find many cards that make up the whole world of <em>Android</em>. The designers found out the point of each character, and give their cards the skills which just shows their personalization. This is a very great way to help illustrate the big scene of the main topic.</p><p>Besides, the art pictures on each card is also drawn in the style of cyberpunk. With clear bounded metal colors, and high-tech assets, we can nearly smell the taste of computers. They drawn every card differently, and made the picture related to the topic and background story. This is also very helpful to the players to get into the game very quickly.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner3_5.jpg" title="The Original Picture of the Professor"><p>After playing the game and enjoying the beautiful pictures, I’m now very interested in the whole Android world.

      &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android: NetRunner&lt;/em&gt; is set in the fictional Android entertainment world. The whole world is a cyberpunk sci-fi world. How it works?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word “punk” comes from punk rock, which is a rock music genre developed between 1974 and 1976. The term ”punk” was first used in relation to rock music by some American critics to describe garage bands and their devotees. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing style, stripped-sown instrumentation, so people use punk rock to express their emotions, and often with political, anti-establishment lyrics. They took root in local scenes that tended to reject association with the mainstream. So we can almost see what’s the feeling of “cyberpunk”. Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction in a future setting, which often center on a conflict among artificial intelligences and megacorporations. That future is often called the antithesis of the generally utpian visions. Megacprporations, cyberspace and hackers are always the basic setting in such stories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This time I was still in Team 8. Our game is EcoLand, a serious game about real-time strategy/management simulation in which the player controls an island populated by wild animals and growths of vegetation while managing factories that harvests the animals for meat. The goal is to wisely invest in resources to maintain animal population and plant life while keeping up with the meat supply demands of the industry over the course of one year.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/EcoLand1.png" title="Ecoland1"><a id="more"></a><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/uXP-dg2qenw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="My-contribution-to-the-project"><a href="#My-contribution-to-the-project" class="headerlink" title="My contribution to the project"></a>My contribution to the project</h2><p>In this project I perform as the only artist in our team. So my major contribution is the art works of the game. Specific art works are showed as follow:</p><ul><li>Concept scene as the loading screen of the game</li><li>Assets such as factories, trees, and animals</li><li>User interface components</li><li>LOGO of the game</li><li>Trailer animations</li></ul><p>Besides the specific art works, I also discussed with my team together of the game concept.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/EcoLand2.png" title="Ecoland LOGO"><h2 id="Different-things-to-do-next-time"><a href="#Different-things-to-do-next-time" class="headerlink" title="Different things to do next time"></a>Different things to do next time</h2><p>Next time we are still in the same team, and the art work is more challenging. I’ll need to design the characters. And for the game world will be bigger next time, I’ll need to talk about many more details with programers, so I need to communicate with my team more. Since we have the experience of the previous prototype, I think it will be easier next time.</p><h2 id="Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process"><a href="#Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process" class="headerlink" title="Things I learned from participating in this process"></a>Things I learned from participating in this process</h2><p>From each experience of making a prototype I can always benefit a lot. So does this time.</p><h3 id="Positive-lessons"><a href="#Positive-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Positive lessons:"></a>Positive lessons:</h3><p>First thing is Trello. This time we tried to use Trello to trace our works. Trello is a kind of online sticker board. This is a very good way to trace the process of our work. And it is very clear that every one has his own works. Like we have four programers, if I need to talk to someone of the art work he needs, I can simply check the trello stickers and find who is in charge of that part.</p><p>Second is seeking advice from experts. Because it is a serious game, we need to make sure what we showed is the correct information to the audience. Our producer Leigh contacted many experts in biological and environmental field, and finally we met an expert from environment school. He confirmed our idea, and gave us some great references. I think that we should always find some experts for advice, not only for pure serious games, because we always want to deliver the information exactly what we want, and they will really help a lot.</p><p>Well the last is about my work myself. This is the first time that I need to take in charge of all the art works in the team, and I’m not very good at the 3D modeling skill. I tried my best, learned modeling things through tutorials and asking the other artists, and finally I’m satisfied with my job. Thanks a lot to Kamchai, Cody, and Chloe. I’ve learnt that feel free to learn from others if you are really not that good.</p><h3 id="Negative-lessons"><a href="#Negative-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Negative lessons:"></a>Negative lessons:</h3><p>Well the first is about our team communication. I have to say that I didn’t know what the programers wanted to make what the game would look like until the last day I saw the nearly finished one. Though I made the concept picture, I didn’t tell them what I expect the game to look like before. And it was a bit late to modify that time. And when I finished some art assets, I think I need response from them, not only ‘You did good’. So I need to communicate with them more.</p><p>The second is about our meetings. Sometimes we cannot express us very clearly that we still have different understandings after the meetings. But this phenomenon is getting better and better as the time flows.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After I play more <em>NetRunner</em>, I started to go deep into the game. I was always mixing up the TCG, CCG, and LCGs. NetRunner is a LCG - Living Card Game, which means besides the core set of the deck you buy the first time, it will continuously sell a small pack of expansion every one or two month, with the specific and same cards in each expansion pack. It is a kind of CCG - Collecting Card Game, players need to collect more cards from expansions.</p><a id="more"></a><p>The main difference of LCG from CCG and TCG1 is that players know what they will get from each version of expansion. There is no randomize in cards. Expansions of most CCGs and TCGs have random cards in each card bag, including a few rare and strong cards, so players need to buy many the same version expansion to get the card they want. Or they can trading with the others in TCGs, buy the specific card of exchange with each other. Because of rareness, some good cards have a very high value in the market, for example, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Pure CCGs like HearthStone are without trading system.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner2_1.png" title="The Genesis Cycle - Data Packs of NetRunner"><p>They are all different from regular card games, which has only one version of deck. And also different from DBG - Deck Building Game, of which the majority of the deck is built during the game instead of before the game. Like <em>Dominion</em>, players use their first version of deck to buy the card they want in the game. TCG, CCG, and LCG all have continuous expansions. They keep giving players new cards, help rebuilding their decks, give them new game experience. I think it’s a really good idea to expand the game’s life span. Dominion also have expansions, but not frequently as LCGs. For DBG and TCG, new expansion always mean new environment or new version.They usually cost one year or more for expansion, with many kinds of new cards.</p><p>More expansions means more profit. For TCG and CCG,they can also sell single rare cards for a very high expense1. But this would lead to bad experience that players with not very much money always do not have powerful decks, make the game unbalanced. That’s exactly what I heard frommany Magic player friends. But - yes, they are still Magic players. They also told me that <em>Magic</em> is such a good game with long time history, which make it a perfect system, a huge card pool, and good balanced. And the most important thing is, the tules are very simple to learn. The only thing that make some players give up is the price.</p><p>Compare to TCG, NetRunner seems to have a great advantage on price. Because of no rare cards, players, players just need spend some money to buy the cheap expansions they need. This help the balance not influenced very much by whether you have much money. And FFG can continuous profit from the cheap but large selling expansions. Also to some extent it is more friendly to new players. Since the profit-model on LCGs is driven by capturing new players rather than keeping players who have already “bought-in”, we can see that FFG is also tempting to push their talent towards different games and away from Netrunner.</p><p>Then, why apply LCG to <em>NetRunner</em>? I think there are several reasons. First,<em>NetRunner</em> do not have a theme with great background story. Those kind of cards are always TCGs or regular themed card games. Only the methods to play makes it easier to expand. Second, the theme cyberpunk comes from the developing technology today, so that it can always add in some new functions just as the real new technology applies. And third, <em>NetRunner</em> is not their first LCG, and won’t be the last. As is said before, FFG is trying to apply more LCGs in the future, to profit more.</p><p>Also this busness mode has impact on the game itself too. Because of choosing LCG, FFG won’t put all powerful cards in the same version of expansion. On forums we can always see some players introducing the best cards in each expansion. And under this mode, FFG can also expand every aspects of the game - the characters, funtions, and playing mode, etc. FFG has their won designers and artists, and their card games are famous for beautiful vision design and high quality components, which also apply to <em>NetRunner</em>.</p><p>Most kind of TCGs do not have a online version, because it may cause the phenomenon of sockpuppets all over the server in order to get and sell rare cards. But LCGs can have a online version. Till now the online game of <em>NetRunner</em> is still developped by players2. Online version is very convenient to get familiar with the rules and decks, and to test the decks.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner2_2.png" title="Jinteki - Online version of NetRunner developed by players">]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This time I was in the Team 8, and our game is called Swift. Swift origins from Zaxxon, an isometric shooter arcade game developed by Sega in 1982. So our game is still isometric, using art style like Monument Valley, remove the combat element, and make it a pure speed game.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/SwiftZaxxon.png" title="Zaxxon"><img src="/assets/blogimg/Swift1.png" title="Swift1"><a id="more"></a><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/A4MCS_JUKNY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="My-contribution-to-the-project"><a href="#My-contribution-to-the-project" class="headerlink" title="My contribution to the project"></a>My contribution to the project</h2><p>In this project I performed as one of the artists. Another artist is Wesley. We separated art works. The specific things I had done were:</p><ul><li>Draw the LOGO, game-start screen, and game-over screen</li><li>Draw the background</li><li>Draw some of the assets</li></ul><img src="/assets/blogimg/Swift2.png" title="Swift background"><p>Besides the specific art works, I also discussed with my team together of the game concept and level design things.</p><h2 id="Different-things-to-do-next-time"><a href="#Different-things-to-do-next-time" class="headerlink" title="Different things to do next time"></a>Different things to do next time</h2><p>In the next project, I found that I will be the only artist in our team. So I think I will need to decide the art style of our game, and design the characters, which was done by Wesley this time. And also in the following projects when I am acting as an artist, I would communicate more with our producer and programmers.</p><p>And next time I think we artists should give out a concept picture of the ideal game. Especially when there is not much time left for the programmers to build the ideal game world. It would be very helpful.</p><h2 id="Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process"><a href="#Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process" class="headerlink" title="Things I learned from participating in this process"></a>Things I learned from participating in this process</h2><p>This time we are more familiar with the process of making a game prototype. We had learned from the previous one, but this time we also found some new lessons both positive and negative.</p><h3 id="Positive-lessons"><a href="#Positive-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Positive lessons:"></a>Positive lessons:</h3><p>First is about the work assignments. This time we always held a short metting before every class, talking about what we had done and what we needed to do in the following two or more days. We set deadline for our each assignment. So our goals were so clear that we do not need to be confused about it, which made our work very effective.</p><p>Second, we set a very challenging goal at the very first - using Html5 to realize 2.5D isometric environment, which pushed us very hard during the process. We learned to draw new things from digital tutorials, as well as programmers tried hard to figure out how to code with Html5. What we had done is beyond our imagination of one month before.</p><p>The third I think is about our game concept. We found Zaxxon is enough playful just try to survive during the move, so we removed the combat system, made it a speed game, and added some powerups to make it more exciting. I love the iteration idea very much. And we also used no inputs besides the arrow keys. We all loved the idea, so that we could put more passion in the game.</p><h3 id="Negative-lessons"><a href="#Negative-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Negative lessons:"></a>Negative lessons:</h3><p>Well the first is that we were too ambitious. Work of artists seems not that difficult, but work of the programmers did. We designed many aspects of the game, but what we realized is not that much. Our expectation was too perfect for a prototype. So finally we do not have enough time to finish all we wanted.</p><p>Second, we didn’t have a specific level design. We didn’t discuss about it very detail and just used the first design, which was also modified during the level build in programs. I think the level design is the core content of a game beside the core play method. So in my opinion I think we should put more emphasis on level design, which would make it a game.</p><p>Third, think about our artists’ work. Actually we didn’t do it very satisfied - some animations was not very good, and some assets had shadows while some not, which seems a bit weird. We will try to do better next time.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Actually that was the first time I heard about the game Android: NetRunner when my teacher told me that we would play it in class on the Game Design class two month ago. I searched on the website, and it seems that it’s a very great new Trading Card Game, like Hearthstone. But I didn’t get any sense until I got the game - There are so many cards with so many characters which excited me greatly, and the nice punk art style also encourages me to explore the game deeply.</p><h2 id="Game-Overview"><a href="#Game-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Game Overview"></a>Game Overview</h2><p>This game is about the story between corporations and hackers. It’s actually a Living Card Game. Not like the TCG games I played before, in NetRunner the two players play different characters - corporation and hacker. Corporation cannot play against corporation, and hacker cannot play against hacker.<br><a id="more"></a></p><p>As a student of computer science before, I have to say that NetRunner performs a highly similar situation towards the real hacking thing. The corporation needs to build servers and protect them with ices while the hacker using his resources to hack the corp’s server. Making runs is always exciting and adventurous.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner1.jpg" title="NetRunner1"><h2 id="Play-The-Game"><a href="#Play-The-Game" class="headerlink" title="Play The Game"></a>Play The Game</h2><p>For the corporation, the main work is to use his clicks to build servers and advance them, protect them with ice - like firewalls of our computer. In servers there is a type of card called Agenda, which the player can get score from them when they are fully advanced. The corp can also install and advance other type of cards in servers to make the hacker confused. Every turn the corp is forced to draw a card and get three initial clicks.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner2.jpg" title="NetRunner2"><p>In the original deck pack, there are four corporation identities to choose. Each identity has a unique skill that can be applied during the whole game. Each identity has 28 special cards for him, and there are 22 general cards for all of them. There are two ways for the corp to win: get seven points first, or kill the hacker. The corp can do damages to the hacker and force him to drop cards from grip, and once the hacker has no card to drop, he will die.</p><p>For the hacker, the main work is to use his resources to invade the corp’s servers and steal the unfully advanced Agenda cards and get score from it in his limited clicks. The player installs virus programs on hardware, using these virus to break the ices outside the server when making a run, try getting the Agendas as well as avoiding himself from being damaged. The hacker has four initial clicks every turn.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/NetRunner3.jpg" title="NetRunner3"><p>There are three original identities for the hacker to choose, and also each has a unique skill to help him invade more easily or protect him from damages. Each identity has 33 special cards for him, and there are 15 general cards for all of them. The hacker can win through the following two ways: get seven score first, or when the corp has no card to draw.</p><h2 id="Thoughts-After-Playing"><a href="#Thoughts-After-Playing" class="headerlink" title="Thoughts After Playing"></a>Thoughts After Playing</h2><p>NetRunner is a game full of strategies and mind games. The corp needs to determine whether to install Agendas or others, to install what kind of ices, to get credits or draw cards - these all will affect the game results. The hacker may bet on which server to invade that he can get the most benefits. Sometimes luck is very important - I once invaded a server at the beginning turn when there was no ices, and I got two Agendas with each values three agenda points. I don’t like this. But most of the time, you can still hold your fortune.</p><p>Like Magic: The Gathering, NetRunner doesn’t limit the number of cards in your deck, but put a restriction on the total agenda points inside. Though for corps they will lose when they have no card to draw in R&amp;D, it’s not a very good idea to build a very huge deck, because larger deck means more Agenda points, so it also increases the chances for the hacker to steal an Agenda.</p><p>There are many expansion packs of NetRunner now, and the company FFG is still designing new cards for the game. To some extent, to get all the cards you want is a big purchase. But unlike many TCGs, LCG games do not have randomized rare cards, which reduces the unbalance caused by purchasing abilities.</p><p>There are also many functions in NetRunner like Tag and Trace. The corp can trace the hacker and tag him, which is not a good sign for the hacker. And different Counters, to help perform the function of the original cards. Well actually NetRunner is the most complicated card game I’ve ever played. That’s also why I love it very much now.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was in the Team 3, which get the toy yo-yo. So we made a game called YoVenture, a 2D action platformer where you use a yo-yo not only for combat, but also as a tool to interact with the environment. We were inspired by the history of the yo-yo in Ancient China. You can find that the dragon in the boss level showed in the following picture is also in Chinese style.</p><img src="/assets/blogimg/YoVenture.png"><a id="more"></a><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/OXmkNLO9B38" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2 id="My-contribution-to-the-project"><a href="#My-contribution-to-the-project" class="headerlink" title="My contribution to the project"></a>My contribution to the project</h2><p>The specific contributions are:</p><ul><li>Name the game</li><li>Program the AI of all the snails</li><li>Program the snail counter</li><li>Program the boss level, including the AI of the dragon, motion of the fireballs, and the fight actions in the level.</li><li>Package the program files to the excutable version</li></ul><p>Besides these, I gave advice to our artists on the art features of Chinese style. And we programmers always work together to solve problems we met during the period.</p><h2 id="Different-things-to-do-next-time"><a href="#Different-things-to-do-next-time" class="headerlink" title="Different things to do next time"></a>Different things to do next time</h2><p>Actually because there are three engineers in our team, and I was not familiar with the pygame before, most of the works like build the program frame of the whole project was done by Sudeep, who is more familiar with pygame. I was a bit lazy. I think if I can travel back now I’ll try to learn more of pygame and share more work with our engineers. So as in the future.</p><p>Also, as a technical artist, I may try to be an artist some time.</p><h2 id="Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process"><a href="#Things-I-learned-from-participating-in-this-process" class="headerlink" title="Things I learned from participating in this process"></a>Things I learned from participating in this process</h2><p>This is the first time I join a team and make our own games. So the experience is very precious for me to get through the process of making a game prototype.</p><h3 id="Positive-lessons"><a href="#Positive-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Positive lessons:"></a>Positive lessons:</h3><p>First, as an engineer, I learned to seperate all the things we need to program and make a standard of the connection ports. Then we can work independently. We made the file versions and changes made to them clearly so that we can combine them together correctly. That’s the source control, which is the basic thing for programers to work together efficiently.</p><p>Second, we are a team, so we tried to make the team communication to be as convenient as possible. We had a shared drive folder and all the thing were uploaded into it, so that we can keep updated. We mail to each other whether there is something need to be discussed. And we talk about our project everytime the prototype class starts. Our team members are very nice too.</p><p>Third, I have to say about our artists’ excellent work. They are Tara and Kamchai. They have very good art skills, and finish all the art materials we need in time. Their passion and enthusiasm were surely a great encourage to the whole team. So I learned that being positive is very important in the project process. We all kept energetic and made out the game in our minds.</p><h3 id="Negative-lessons"><a href="#Negative-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Negative lessons:"></a>Negative lessons:</h3><p>There are surely something we need to improve in the future. There are also three things I think that is most urgent to be improved. First is that we didn’t have a design document. All the works were assigned orally, and sometimes I actually do not know what’s the next step. We need to make goals. Second, we uploaded all the files to the drive, but didn’t classify them very well, that we always needed to ask where to find a specific file. Third is that we are always hungry before one o’clock when the class ends.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This project was done by January 16, 2015, as the final project of the course Interactive Interface</p><p>Design &amp; Development. Using CSS + HTML5 + Javascript.<br><img src="/assets/blogimg/PizzaDIY.jpg" title="UI sample"></p><a id="more"></a><div class="video-container"><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/smIBJR2gQwk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><p>This was a team work, with two partners from Industry Design College designed the page, and I was the programmer to make it true. We aimed to find a UI mode of collocation on cell phones. We compared many different modes, and finally chose my idea of using a round menu. We all agreed that this idea would make users feel more interesting, and our user experience test proved it. It feels really good to using your techniques to make more fun. During the process I applied the object-oriented concepts – the ‘ring’ is a class and can be used on different themes besides pizza DIY through just replacing the icons.</p><h2 id="Code-sample"><a
